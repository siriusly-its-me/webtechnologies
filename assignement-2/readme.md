# Application README
## New Features in JavaScript

This application has been enhanced with four new JavaScript functions to improve its functionality and user experience. Below are the details of the new features:

    ** Add Email Addresses Button ** : In the "GROUPE > Cr√©er un groupe" tab, a new button has been added. This button allows the users to add email addresses to the group they are creating, facilitating the process of inviting group members.

    ** Delete Button in Tables **: A delete button has been added to each table. This button can be used to permanently delete the corresponding table. This provides users with the ability to manage their tables more efficiently.

    ** Add Image and Comment Button **: When viewing a table, a new button labeled "Add Image and Comment" has been introduced. This button allows users to add an image along with a comment to the table, enhancing the visual and descriptive aspects of the tables.

    ** Edit Title on Click **: Users can now modify the title of a table by simply clicking on it. This feature provides a more intuitive and direct way to update the titles of tables according to the user's preference.

## Usage

    Create a Group: Navigate to the "Create a Group" tab and use the "Add Email Addresses" button to add emails to your group.

    Delete Tables: In the tables view, use the delete button to permanently remove any table you no longer need.

    Add Images and Comments: When viewing a table, click the "Add Image and Comment" button to add visual and textual elements to the table.

    Edit Titles: To modify a table's title, simply click on the title text and make your desired changes.


## Google MAP API
There is now a map available, with pins on certain places (here beaches).

## Comments
For now on, all of this is only visual, as there is no database or backend to properly save the changes. 

You may also see that when you add an image on the page, it is downloaded on your computer. I tried to bypass the fact that I did not have any (working) database, to download the pictures directly in the folder : "images" on the project. But in the end, I cannot do it to ensure privacy and user preferences. So I left it to demonstrate how we can use the download option. 

For the Google MAP APi, I plan to implement a dynamic way to add pins on the map, using a DB and JavaScript. But for now on, if you want to add a pin, you have to copy/paste in the HTML code.
